# Time series plot

## Description

Plots time series of covariates, case counts, or incidence rates.

```r
plot_timeseries(
  data,
  var,
  time,
  type = "cov",
  pop = NULL,
  pt = 1e+05,
  area = NULL,
  aggregate_space = NULL,
  aggregate_time = NULL,
  aggregate_space_fun = "mean",
  aggregate_time_fun = "mean",
  facet = FALSE,
  highlight = NULL,
  transform = "identity",
  title = NULL,
  var_label = NULL,
  legend = NULL,
  ylab = NULL,
  xlab = NULL,
  free_y_scale = FALSE,
  palette = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- `data`: Data frame containing equally spaced (daily, weekly, monthly) covariate or disease case observations for one or multiple locations.
- `var`: Name of the column identifying the variable to be plotted.
- `time`: Name of the variable that identifies the temporal dimension of the data frame. Its values must be in date format ("yyyy-mm-dd") representing the day of observation for daily data, the first day of the week for weekly, or the first day of the month for monthly observations.
- `type`: Character that specifies the type of variable in `var`. Possible values include 'cov' (covariate, default), 'counts' (case counts), and 'inc' (case incidence). If `type='inc'`, `pop` is required.
- `pop`: Character identifying the variable name for population. Only needed if `type='inc'`.
- `pt`: Numerical only used for `type='inc'`. It represents the scale of the person-time (default 100,000) for incidence rates.
- `area`: Name of variable that identifies the different locations (e.g., areal units) for which a time series is available.
- `aggregate_space`: Name of variable used to define spatial aggregation groups.
- `aggregate_time`: Temporal scale used to perform temporal aggregation. Options are: "week" (ISO 8601), "month", "year".
- `aggregate_space_fun`: Character indicating the function to be used in the aggregation over space for `type="cov"`. Options are "mean" (default), "median", "sum". For case counts and incidence, "sum" is always applied.
- `aggregate_time_fun`: Character indicating the function to be used in the aggregation over time for `type="cov"`. Options are "mean" (default), "median", "sum". For case counts and incidence, "sum" is always applied.
- `facet`: If TRUE a separate time series for each space unit is plotted in different facets.
- `highlight`: ID of the `area` to be highlighted. Using this option will only color the selected spatial unit and set all the rest to grey.
- `transform`: Character, defaults to "identity" (i.e., no transformation). Transforms the y-axis for better visualization. Useful options include "log10p1" `log10(x+1)` useful for case counts and incidence with 0s, or any of the in-built ggplot2 options such as "log10" `log10(x)`, "log1p" `log(x+1)`, and "sqrt" `sqrt(x)` (check all possible options using `?scale_y_continuous`).
- `title`: Optional title of the plot.
- `var_label`: Character with a custom name for the case or covariate variable.
- `legend`: Character with a custom name for the legend.
- `ylab`: Label for the y-axis.
- `xlab`: Label for the x-axis.
- `free_y_scale`: Logical, default FALSE. Allows different scales in the y_axis when facets are used.
- `palette`: GHR, RColorBrewer or colorspace palette (e.g. "Purp"). Single R colors in `colors()` or hex codes can be used for single time series or facets. Use "-" before the palette name (e.g., "-Reds") to reverse it. Defaults to a dark green when `area` is NULL, when `facet` is TRUE or when `highlight` is used (i.e. single time series), otherwise defaults to the "IDE2" palette.

## Returns

A ggplot2 time series plot.
